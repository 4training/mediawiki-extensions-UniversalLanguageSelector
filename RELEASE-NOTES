== UniversalLanguageSelector 2013.01 ==
Released at 2013-01-31.

== Known issues ==
We fixed an issue where ULS preferences for logged in users were not
saved between different pages. This depends on a fix on MediaWiki core
which is not yet in any released MediaWiki version. It is on a queue to
be backported to 1.19, 1.20.

=== Noteworthy changes ===
* More unit tests were added
* Used upstream libraries jquery.ime, jquery.webfonts and jqeury.uls were updated.
* A "Special" region is now supported for custom languages that don't fit into any region.
* An alias for the non-standard language code 'als' was added, redirecting to 'gsw'.

== Bug fixes ==
* (bug 42384) Don't show the "previous language" tooltip when
  the ULS panel is shown
* (bug 42440) Incorrect language was shown as selected in display setttings
* (bug 42375) Show current IME language in ULS input settings
* (bug 44010) ULS could make log entries appear in wrong language
