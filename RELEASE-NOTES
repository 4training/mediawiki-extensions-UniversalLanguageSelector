Released at 2013-08-27.

=== Noteworthy changes ===
* Added support for event logging. To use it you need to install the EventLogging extension. The support is considered to be experimental.
To enable event logging, add following lines to your LocalSettings.php:

require_once "$IP/extensions/EventLogging/EventLogging.php";
$wgMainCacheType    = CACHE_MEMCACHED;
$wgMemCachedServers = array( '127.0.0.1:11211' );
$wgEventLoggingBaseUri = 'http://localhost:8080/event.gif';
$wgEventLoggingFile = '/var/log/mediawiki/events.log';
