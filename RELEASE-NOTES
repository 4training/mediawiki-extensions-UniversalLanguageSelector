== UniversalLanguageSelector 2013.05-rc ==
Released at 2013-05-29.

The last month saw significant changes in the Universal Language Selector extension: many bugs were fixed and some design changes were introduced.

The functionality of the cog icon to be shown in the sidebar was improved, but this is still an experimental feature.

Notable bug fixes:
* Major bugs in the IME functionality on Microsoft Internet Explorer 8, 9 and 10 were fixed.
* IME selector positioning is now more consistent: always under the input box, and matching the direction.
* Anonymous users cannot change the language in any mode if $wgULSAnonCanChangeLanguage is set to false.
* A link to open the ULS is added near the language selector on Special:Preferences.
* The positioning of the ULS windows was cleaned up so that the appear in more predictable places on the screen.
* ULS triggers are not shown to users who disabled JavaScript.
* The checkbox that enables and disables webfonts was removed. The feature is now always on.
* The title 'System font' is now translatable.
* Fonts for the Syriac alphabet and support for the 'syc' language code were added.
* Webfonts test page was updated.
* A "stroked keyboard" icon was added to the IME selector to disable the IME feature per user. When this is done, a notification bubble is shown saying how to restore it.
* The bubble for restoring the previous language is not shown to anonymous users if they can't change the language.
* Webfonts are loaded correctly from the preferences.
* jquery.i18n files can be loaded from the same domain to fix an issue with old Microsoft Internet Explorer versions.
