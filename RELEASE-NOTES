== UniversalLanguageSelector 2014.11 ==
Released at 2014-11-29.

=== Noteworthy changes ===
* ULS WebAPI documentation is now localized. Only works in MediaWiki 1.24 and
newer.
* T67516: Removed font-size for ULS language selection panel buttons, which
caused tiny font sizes on the Monobook skin.
* Small compatibility fix when both ULS and VisualEditor are in use.
* About 20 new languages are now supported in the language selector and a
couple language names were changes.
* A JavaScript error no longer happens on pages without any headings.
* Added support for WOFF2 webfont format. Note that there are no WOFF2 webfonts
in the font repository yet due to pending issues in WOFF2 font generation.
