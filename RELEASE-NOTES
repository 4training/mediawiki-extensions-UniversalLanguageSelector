== UniversalLanguageSelector 2014.02 ==
Released at 2014-02-28.

=== Noteworthy changes ===
* Detect tofu before applying any default fonts. See: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Universal_Language_Selector/WebFonts#How_webfonts_are_applied.3F for technical documentation about how tofu detection works in ULS.
* Bug 60304: Added enableWebfonts preference. Each wiki can be configured to load the fonts by default using the new global variable $wgULSWebfontsEnabled. Its default value is true (to load fonts).
* ULS is now much lighter for the browser thanks to many changes:
** Bug 56292: All SVG images were optimized to reduce their size even 50% in some cases.
** I18n related jquery.i18n and messages code is now loaded only later after user interacts with ULS.
** We removed a dependency to a big JavaScript module which was no longer needed to support anonymous preferences.
* Bug 60815: Add Marwari (rwr) and Ottoman Turkish (ota) to the languages supported by ULS.

=== Fonts ===
* Add Iranian Serif and Iranian Sans Bold fonts.
* Removed Amiri font from Persian.
* Replaced Xerxes font with Artaxerxes.

=== Input methods ===
* Bug 53695: For languages which have no input methods, the "Use native keyboard" option is now shown as selected by default.
* Added Venetian input method.
